All new WordPress WooCommerce plugin by which a customer can group all reviews by its ratings.

== Description ==
WooCommerce Product Review Sorting plugin helps prospective buyers of a product to sort and go through its reviews as per the ratings it received from other customers. 
Suppose, a customer wants to buy a product from your Woostore and wants to check if anyone has given it a 1 star rating. If the buyer goes to its review section, the last review written will appear at the top, which may have other rating. And this is where the Woocommere product review sorting plugin will help the buyer make things easier.
The plugin places a dropdown menu on the review page to let the end-user select the reviews based on the ratings. If the user selects the “1 star” option from the drop-down list, all the reviews with 1 star ratings will be grouped and displayed. Similarly, the user can select “2, 3, 4 or 5 star” ratings separately to check out the corresponding feedback/reviews of these respective ratings.

= Features =
*   WooCommerce Product Review Sorting Plugin groups product reviews based on ratings to allow future buyers learn about a specific product before purchasing it.
*   Creates a dropdown menu – Sort by Rating – on the Review tab of single product pages to let buyers choose an option ( 1 star, 2 stars...or any other term you use to separate these) and group reviews accordingly.
*   This is an extremely light-weight plugin; it doesn't hamper the speed of your website and ensures smooth transition and product sorting.
*   This killer plugin is easy to set up, use and install. You need not be a coding or developing expert to understand how the plugin works. Just install and let it do the rest.

Reviews and ratings are highly considered as necessary sales drivers, and these are one of the most important information a customer wishes to have before spending on a product. After all, it is always better to know about positives as well as the negatives of the product than to find about its loopholes after purchasing.
